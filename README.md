<h1 align="center"> YouTube Video to Audio </h1>

A GUI application that serves to do just one thing - download and convert a YouTube video, to audio (primarily for music); with the ability to trim the file just before downloading - given start/end time - so you don't have to listen to annoying intro's/outro's.

Most online services nowadays have too many options which are tedious to browse through, or require subscriptions to bypass limitations on things such as the download size; hence this program. Also, some videos on YouTube have unnecessary intro's/outro's which I don't want to tune into when I'm listening to music; hence the ability to trim those off.

## Features
- Straightforward Graphical User Interface.
- Quick YouTube to audio conversion.
- Trim/cut the audio file; download its subclip from `start` to `end`.
- Change output file-name/directory.
